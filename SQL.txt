Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database. It includes creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables according to rules designed both to protect the data and to make the database more flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency.

A - Atomicity
C - Consistency
I - Isolation
D - Durability

First normal form
Eliminate repeating groups in individual tables.
Create a separate table for each set of related data.
Identify each set of related data with a primary key.

Constraints
Constraints provide details about the usage of a column and are applied after specifying the column's data type.
They enable the database to reject any inserted data that violates a particular constraint.
The following statement is used to impose constraints on the "employee" table.

Below is the query to create a table student with a set of constraints.

     CREATE TABLE  student(
     student_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
     student_Name TEXT UNIQUE,
     Department TEXT NOT NULL); 
PRIMARY KEY can be utilized to uniquely identify a row in a table.
When attempting to insert a row with the same value as an existing row in the table, a constraint violation will occur, preventing the insertion of the new row.
UNIQUE columns contain distinct values for each row, similar to "PRIMARY KEY" columns, but unlike primary key columns, a table can have multiple unique columns..
NOT NULL columns must have a value assigned to them.
When attempting to insert a row without providing a value for a "NOT NULL" column, a constraint violation will occur, preventing the insertion of the new row.
Task
Write a query to create a table employee with the mentioned constraints on the columns :

employee_id - INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
employee_Name - TEXT UNIQUE,
Department - TEXT NOT NULL

Normal Forms	Description
1NF	Any relation is said to be in 1NF if it contains only atomic values.
2NF	Any relation is said to be in 2NF only if it is in 1NF AND all other attributes except the primary key are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
3NF	A relation is said to be in 3NF only if it is in 2NF AND there is no transition dependency between any attributes.
4NF	A relation is said to be in 4NF only if it is in BCNF(will be discussed further) and the relation doesn't consist of any multivalued dependency
5NF	A relation is said to be in 5NF only if it is in 4NF and the relation does not have any join dependancy, i.e. any join performed with respect to the attributes must not cause any loss.

Atomicity
The term Atomicity means that the data should remain Atomic during the entire transaction process. It means that either the process should be completed or should not occur at all. Let’s understand this using an example. Suppose you have a task to fill a water bottle. If the process of filling water has to be atomic, you will have only two options. You can either fill the bottle completely or not fill even a single drop of water.

You cannot fill the bottle half or three-fourths. This is the simple meaning of Atomicity in DBMS. A transaction can be completed in one go or cannot occur at all. There is nothing like a partial transaction in DBMS.

Atomicity has two major operations in DBMS:

Abort: If a transaction is aborted, the changes in the database are not visible.
Commit: Commit is used to permanently save the changes made during the transaction in DBMS.
Consistency
Consistency means the Integrity Constraints must be maintained appropriately so that the data remains consistent before and after the transaction. The term Consistency of ACID Properties in DBMS simply emphasizes preserving the data before and after the transaction process.

For example,  if you have Rs. 1,000 and you purchase a product worth Rs. 200 then, the remaining amount is Rs. 800 and the seller gets Rs. 200. But, you sum up the total money before and after the transaction process, its total sum is Rs. 1,000. Thus, data consistency is maintained during the transaction process.

Isolation
Isolation means multiple transactions can occur simultaneously without affecting each other. In simple words, Isolation refers to consistency in data among concurrent transactions occurring in the database. It aims to assure that no data should affect another one when multiple transaction processes are going on.

Suppose you and your friend purchase an item at the same time. When you proceed with online payment, you are able to do so as if there is no other transaction happening. But, in reality, your friend’s payment has been done at the same time. Thus, Isolation determines how the changes made during one transaction are to other transactions in the database.

Durability
Durability is one of the important ACID Properties in DBMS as it assures that the data should remain permanent in the database after successful transaction operations. This is important because if the system suffers from a failure, the data should remain intact so that it can be accessed.

This is the reason why databases can survive even if the system crashes or suffers from failure. To assure Durability, the changes made in the data should be committed every time in the database. This will maintain the Durability of the data in the database.

This is how ACID Properties in DBMS assure data integrity during the whole transaction process. These properties are prerequisites for studying Transaction Processing and Concurrency Control in DBMS,
