Triggers : Store procedure technique

Store Procedure : 
A stored procedure is a set of Structured Query Language (SQL) statements with an assigned name, which are stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS) as a group, so it can be reused and shared by multiple programs.

Trigger : 
insert : before insert, after insert
update : before update, after update
delete : 

Drop - it will permanently delete the schema or database - it can't be recovered

Truncate - it will truncate the schema : it will delete the tuples present in schema - but structure of schema
will remains same

aggregate function : 
sum
max
min
avg
std
count
